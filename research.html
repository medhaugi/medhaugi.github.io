	 <!-- <p> The oceans are a large sink for anthropogenic carbon
	    dioxide (CO2) and the processes responsible for the
	    absorption of CO2 by the ocean are influenced by, and
	    sensitive to, the atmospheric CO2 concentration, changes
	    in atmospheric temperature and winds, ocean temperature,
	    ocean circulation, and ocean nutrient supply leading
	    therefore to several potential oceanic feedbacks.  <br>
	    
	    I am currently quantifying CO2 uptake by the ocean,
	    investigating the sensitivity of the marine carbon cycle
	    and acidification levels to processes such as surface
	    boundary conditions (e.g, pCO2, SST and freshwater
	    fluxes), ocean mixing, sea-ice extent, and ocean
	    circulation and deriving new dynamical constraints to
	    diagnose the vertical structure of the dissolved inorganic
	    carbon (DIC), or any other biogeochemical tracer in the
	    oceans (with David Marshall and Gideon Henderson). These
	    different projects involve theoretical and modeling tools
	    including adjoint-based methods, the latter providing new
	    insight on the amplitude and spatial pattern of CO2 uptake
	    by the ocean and future acidification levels. <br> </p>

	  <!--<p> In order to estimate the predictability limits of
	    Atlantic climate, we explore the fastest growing
	    perturbations leading to the amplification of large-scale
	    meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and sea surface
	    temperature (SST) anomalies in an ocean general
	    circulation model.  The analysis of the optimal
	    perturbations provides with information on the sensitivity
	    of Atlantic ocean to perturbations and on the error growth
	    (uncertainties) in the model and therefore the implied
	    limits on predictability.  The results showed an
	    amplification of MOC anomalies on a timescale of 19 years
	    when the perturbations are constrained to the upper ocean
	    compared to 7 years when the perturbations are permitted
	    over the entire ocean depth.  These results indicate that
	    predictability experiments in which only the atmospheric
	    state is perturbed (equivalent to perturbing the upper
	    ocean only) may lead to an overestimate of the ocean
	    predictability time.  In addition, optimal perturbations
	    of upper ocean temperature can be amplified a factor of
	    1.6 after 15 years in the northern part of the basin.  The
	    ocean actively participates in the amplification of the
	    anomalies rather than just integrating over the
	    atmospheric forcing however it is not necessarily
	    correlated with the growth of MOC anomalies. <br>

	  <p> Moreover, I am constructing an empirical model using
	    observations over the past several decades in order to
	    predict interannual fluctuations of the North Atlantic sea
	    surface temperature anomalies.  Preliminary results show
	    that the model has predictive skill up to 3 to 4 years,
	    forecast skill on longer timescales is greatly reduced.
	    Additionally, the model is used to diagnose how different
	    ocean regions impact the predictions.</p>

	    <h2><em>Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation</em></h2>

	 <!-- <p> In the North Atlantic, the large-scale ocean circulation
	    transports heat from low to high latitudes.  The strength
	    of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), similarly
	    to Atlantic climate variability, is believed to vary over
	    a wide range of time scales.  We explored the sensitivity
	    and variability of the Atlantic MOC by investigating the
	    non-normal ocean dynamics in an ocean general circulation
	    model.  Although the linearized dynamics are found to be
	    stable, initial temperature and salinity anomalies can
	    generate a large amplification of MOC anomalies after
	    several years. Deep density anomalies in the northern part
	    of the basin are found to excite the largest amplification
	    of MOC anomalies after about 7 years.  The growth of MOC
	    anomalies can be understood by examining the time
	    evolution of deep zonal density gradients related to the
	    MOC via the thermal wind relation.  The propagation of the
	    density anomalies, which depends on the mean flow velocity
	    and the mean density gradient, determines the growth time
	    scale of the MOC anomalies. <br>

	  <p> Using simple box models of the circulation, we found
	    that stochastic salinity anomalies were far more efficient
	    than temperature anomalies at sustaining MOC variability;
	    and that density gradients at high latitudes were more
	    efficient than low-latitude ones at inducing MOC
	    variability over a wide range of frequencies.</p>

<!--	  <p>The interannual variability of ocean tropical sea surface
	    temperature (SST) is commonly believed to be dominated by
	    coupled ocean-atmosphere feedbacks.  Even though
	    atmospheric excitation of the observed tropical SST
	    variability may be significant, the precise role of
	    ocean-only dynamics in this variability remains unknown
	    due to lack of observations.  A few studies invoked ocean
	    dynamics including the meridional overturning circulation
	    and wave instabilities to explain this variability.
	    Recently, we proposed a mechanism relying on the
	    excitation of deep salinity anomalies in the vicinity of
	    the western boundary (for example by mesoscale
	    eddies). After a rapid geostrophic adjustment, the
	    propagation of the coastal and equatorial Kelvin waves
	    creates SST anomalies in the tropical Atlantic on a
	    timescale of 3 to 4 years. This mechanism is solely driven
	    by the ocean dynamics (without the participation of the
	    MOC nor tropical wave instabilities) and does not rely on
	    any atmospheric feedback.  <br>

	  <p> On shorter time scales, sea surface temperatures in the
	  tropical can reach unusually large values in localized
	  regions (tropical "hot spots").  We analyzed possible
	  feedbacks and perturbations (deterministic or stochastic)
	  responsible for their formation using a 1D idealized coupled
	  ocean-atmosphere model.
